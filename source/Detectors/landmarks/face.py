    # BodyCR 
    ### Body Capture and Recognition
    ### Face Landmarks
    #### An simple way to recognize poses, hands and face using Mediapipe and OpenCV, totalizing 532 landmarks recognizing in real-time

    ----------

    By convention, use cr instead of BodyCR, follow the good practice of use `import BodyCR as cr`.
    By convention, import from instead BodyCR.Modules, follow the good practice of use `from BodyCR.Modules import <Required modules>`. Or import directly of BodyCR main module

    Note: Use separate modules can be a pretty difficult, we recommend use the instead main module subdivision. You can import all submodules since Detector to Modules with an easy way, more simple than write this: `import BodyCR as cr`
