    # BodyCR 
    ### Body Capture Recognition

    #### An simple way to recognize poses and hands using Mediapipe and OpenCV

    ----------

    By convention, use cr instead of BodyCR, follow the good practice of use `import BodyCR as cr`.
    By convention, import from instead BodyCR.Utils, follow the good practice of use `from BodyCR.Utils import <Required modules>`.

    Note: Use separate modules can be a pretty difficult, we recommend use the instead main module subdivision. You can import all submodules since Detector to Modules with an easy way, more simple than write this: `import BodyCR as cr`
